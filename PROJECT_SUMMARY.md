# P2P Energy Trading Platform - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

You now have a complete **Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Platform** that combines:
- **Smart Contracts** (Solidity) for secure energy trading
- **React Frontend** (Vite) for user interaction
- **Web3 Integration** (Ethers.js) for blockchain connectivity

## 🚀 What's Been Created

### 1. Smart Contract (`EnergyTrading.sol`)
A comprehensive smart contract with features:
- **Energy Listing**: Sellers can list energy with amount and price
- **Energy Purchase**: Buyers can purchase listed energy with ETH
- **Marketplace Management**: View active listings, cancel listings
- **Energy Balance Tracking**: Track purchased energy balances
- **Transaction History**: Complete purchase and sales history

### 2. React Frontend (Vite + Tailwind CSS)
A modern, responsive web application with:
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask connection
- **Energy Marketplace**: Browse and purchase energy
- **Listing Management**: Create and manage energy listings
- **User Dashboard**: View purchases, sales, and energy balance
- **Real-time Updates**: Live blockchain data integration

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### For Energy Sellers:
- List excess renewable energy for sale
- Set custom pricing per kWh
- Manage active listings
- Cancel listings if needed
- Track sales history

#### For Energy Buyers:
- Browse available energy listings
- Purchase energy with cryptocurrency
- View energy balance
- Track purchase history
- Transparent pricing and seller information

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Functions:
```solidity
// Core trading functions
listEnergy(uint256 energyAmount, uint256 pricePerKWh)
purchaseEnergy(uint256 listingId)
cancelListing(uint256 listingId)

// View functions
getActiveListings()
getUserListings(address user)
getUserPurchases(address user)
getUserEnergyBalance(address user)
```

### Frontend Components:
- **Web3Context**: Manages blockchain connection and contract interaction
- **Navbar**: Wallet connection and navigation
- **Home**: Energy marketplace with listing cards
- **ListEnergy**: Form to create new energy listings
- **MyListings**: Manage user's energy listings
- **MyPurchases**: View purchase history and energy balance

## 🌐 Current Status

✅ **Smart Contract**: Deployed and running on local blockchain (port 8546)
✅ **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000
✅ **Web3 Integration**: Connected and functional
✅ **Local Blockchain**: Hardhat node with test accounts

### Contract Address:
- **Deployed to**: `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`
- **Network**: Localhost (127.0.0.1:8546)
- **Chain ID**: 1337

## 🔧 How to Use

### 1. MetaMask Setup
1. Install MetaMask browser extension
2. Add custom network:
   - **Network Name**: Localhost 8546
   - **RPC URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8546
   - **Chain ID**: 1337
   - **Currency**: ETH

3. Import test accounts using private keys from Hardhat output

### 2. Using the Application
1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" in the navigation
2. **Browse Energy**: View available energy listings on homepage
3. **Purchase Energy**: Click "Purchase Energy" on any listing
4. **List Energy**: Go to "List Energy" to sell your energy
5. **Manage**: Use "My Listings" and "My Purchases" to track activity

## 🎮 Available Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start frontend development server
npm run node         # Start local blockchain
npm run deploy       # Deploy smart contracts
npm run demo         # Run contract demonstration

# Testing & Building
npm run test         # Run smart contract tests
npm run compile      # Compile smart contracts

```

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Access Control**: Users can only cancel their own listings
- **Payment Validation**: Ensures sufficient payment before transfer
- **State Management**: Prevents double-selling and invalid purchases
- **Owner Restrictions**: Sellers cannot buy their own energy
- **Balance Tracking**: Accurate energy balance management

## 🌱 Next Steps & Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
